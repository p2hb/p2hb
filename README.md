[![Discord Bots](https://top.gg/api/widget/818706022675120138.svg)](https://top.gg/bot/818706022675120138)

## Update
Due to upcoming changes to the Discord API, this project is no longer maintained. If you wish to use set up your own instance, the instructions are listed below. 

## Running
While I would prefer if you just [added the main instance of the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=818706022675120138&permissions=8&scope=bot) to your server, here is the setup process to run your own instance.

1. **Get Python 3.8 or higher**

This is required to run the bot.

2. **Set up venv**

Do `python3.8 -m venv venv`

3. **Install dependencies**

We use Poetry to manage dependencies. Make sure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed, and just run `poetry install`.

4. **Create the database in MongoDB**

Please refer to the [MongoDB website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) to do this.

5. **Setup config**

Create a `config.py` file in root directory using the following template:

```py
import random

DEFAULT_PREFIX = ">" # the bot's default prefix
BOT_TOKEN = "token" # your bot's token
DATABASE_URI = "mongodb+srv://...url" # MongoDB URI, you can get this once you set it up
DATABASE_NAME = "name" # name of database
DBL_TOKEN = "" # Top.gg token - not required

def RATES(bet):
  if (true) # the random function of the gambling games
    return true
```

That's it! You should be ready to run the bot now.
